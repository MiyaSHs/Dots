My dotfiles for Hyprland and Waybar

I use Dunst and Wofi but you can change that to whatever you'd like in the config.

> ( Haven't themed dunst or wofi, thats why no config files included )

The wallpapers folder can be put in your home folder,
the rest ( hypr & waybar ) can be put in your .config folder.
